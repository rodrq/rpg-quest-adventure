# Character Creation Process

This document describes the process of creating a character in our web application.

## Process Flow

1. **User Input**: The user enters their character's name, password, and class in the web application.

2. **Web Application Request**: The web application sends a POST request to the backend server. The request is sent to the /character endpoint and includes the character's name, password, and class as data.

3. **Server Processing**: The backend server receives the request and saves the character information in the 'characters' table in the PostgreSQL database.

4. **Database Confirmation**: The database sends a confirmation back to the server once the character information has been successfully saved.

5. **Server Response**: The server sends a response back to the web application, indicating that the character has been created successfully.

6. **User Confirmation**: The web application displays a confirmation to the user, indicating that their character has been created.

## Sequence Diagram
